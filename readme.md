## üçî McSub ‚Äì Client Side MailChimp Subscriptions

McSub (Mailchimp Subscriptions) is a tiny < 1.4kb (gzipped) vanilla JavaScript ES6 implementation that acts a simple wrapper for client side email subscriptions with Mailchimp. McSub enables an Ajax-like integration for email subscriptions using MailChimp and is a replacement to their jQuery dependant monolothic embedded form script that MailChimp requires you to include.

The original score for this implementation before was from [Michiel Vandewalle](https://github.com/michiel-vandewalle) with his component the [Mailchimp AJAX form submit](https://github.com/michiel-vandewalle/Mailchimp-AJAX-form-submit-vanillaJS).

[Codepen Example](https://codepen.io/panoply/pen/erqbwx)

### Install

`yarn add mcsub`

### HTML

McSub will automatically add a robot input to your `form` and dynamically modify it to fit the prerequisites MailChimp requires in their embedded forms which this means you will only need the bare minimum boiler HTML subscription form when you're using McSub, example:

    <div id="form-wrapper-id">
       <form action="https://*.list-manage.com/subscribe/post">
          <input type="email" name="EMAIL" placeholder="Email">
          <button type="submit" name="subscribe">
             Submit
          </button>
          <div id="response"></div>
       </form>
    </div>

The McSub Subscriber HTML form is vastly different to the standard HTML form that Mailchimp requires from you. This approach means you can customise the style of the form to best fit your integration. As an added bonus McSub will also re-write your form to the Mailchimp defaults as a fallback.

> Ensure the **https** protocol is ALWAYS used in the form action


### Initialise
Simply add McSub to your build `import Mcsub from 'mcsub';` and initialise it according to your requirements.

    new Mcsub('#form-wrapper-id', {
	    user:  'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz',
	    list:  '123456789',
	    callback:  'cb',
	    reponse:  '#response',
        onSubmit(){
            console.log(this.submit); // Example
        },
        complete(){
            console.log(this.inputs); // Example
        }
    });

## Options
**element**<br>
The `element` option is a **required** option that is the selector of the form wrapper. You must always wrap your form within a `div`.

**user**<br>
The `user` option is a **required** option of the user id for your Mailchimp account. You can obtain your user id in the copy/paste section of the embedded form generators form `action` in your Mailchimp account.

**list**<br>
The `list` option is a **required** option that is your subscription email list id. The email list id is the list in which your subscriptions will be saved to. You can obtain this id in the copy/paste section of the embedded form generators form `action` of your Mailchimp account

**callback**<br>
The `callback` option allows you to define a custom callback parameter. It defaults to `cb` but you can change it incase `cb` is being used by something else.

**response**<br>
The `response` option defaults to an element within your `<form>` with the `id` of `#response`. Mailchimp will return responses which show up within this element and depending on the response type, a class of either `.error` or `.success` will be added to the element giving you additional styling.

**onInit**<br>
The `onInit()` option function is run on init after the form subit listener is applied.

**onSubmit**<br>
The `onSubmit()` option function is run on form submission. Access the Forms elements via `this` to get things like the form submit button, inputs etc.

**complete**<br>
The `complete()` option function is run after form submission has completed and validation text has been appended within the `response` element. Access the form via `this` to get things like the form submit button, inputs etc. The reason complete runs after validation text is appended is because only then are we sure that we have received the response from MailChimp.
